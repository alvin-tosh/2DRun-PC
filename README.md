# Sneaky-Mansion-PC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a PC game made with UNITY 2020.3 game engine about the player🤗 trying to sneak around a haunted mansion to avoid getting caught by ghosts💀 and gargoyles👹 hunting for your blood and soul 😈
The Atmosphere is meant to be creepy and the environment and audio help set the tempo to terrifyingly fun.😨
It is a single level game developed for a week during GAMEJAM week.
Enjoy and feel free to contribute more levels, characters and mechanics.🔧⚙️🧲

**PS: There is a kernel Error but since the game works perfectly and its probably a UNITY bug.**
>Kernel at index (0) is invalid
